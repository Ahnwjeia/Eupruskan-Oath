Type-31,SHIP,"The Type-31 is a small and nimble Eupruskan hull. It’s main purpose is to scout ahead of fleets or intercept stragglers.
An ancient design philosophy of cast armor combined with Eupruskan ad hoc solutions make their vessels a dangerous threat. Despite a lack of shield technology and few weapon mounts, Eupruskan ships have built-in high tech components. To offset a lack of crew, every ship has neural integration connections, so captains and pilots can take direct control of a vessel.",,,,,
Type-32,SHIP,"A small brawler, the Type-32 is made to face larger targets than itself. Its firepower greatly exceeds other ships of the same classification.

Type-41,SHIP,"The Type-41 exists to fill the long range role for destroyer crafts. Its large weapon mount, many missile slots and heavy armor puts it in the same league as cruisers. However, it’s small shilouette makes it ideal to avoid capital ships and slow moving projectiles.

Type-42,SHIP,"A follow up to the Type-32, the Type-42 takes the brawler role to the destroyer size. Its main armament consists of two large forward facing weapon mounts, accompanied by medium weapon mounts. Its forward facing fire power is unmatched by many ships, but the focus on front heavy armaments leads to a lack of internal space for point defense capabilities. Without escort, the Type-42 can easily be outmaneuvered by nimble crafts that can disable its engines.

Type-FT1,SHIP,"The Type-FT1 is a small logistics unit, meant to transport fuel and cargo. It is lightly armed but boasts tremendous armor and is thus anything but an easy target for scoundrels. It is, however, unfit for long engagements and cannot be properly used for a combat role.

Type-X1,SHIP,"This ship is an experimental design. Its systems work akin to those of an afflictor, yet it is outfitted with a large weapon mount as a frigate. The Type-X1 is a dangerous vessel for any foe.

zemstvodesc,CUSTOM,This planet’s surface is barren and lifeless. The hue of the atmosphere hints at habitable conditions.,,"The surface of this barren world is dust and ruins. The ruins have a strange resemblance to natural formations, yet they can be distinguished from such by geometrical patterns on them. Huge ramps and sealed gates on the ground imply sophisticated subterranean facilities, spanning across the whole planet.",,,
burlakdesc,CUSTOM,"A Domain era Sporeship, that is still being used.",,"This station looks like an old Domain era terraforming ship. Its outer shell is covered by repeating patterns, that have a resemblance of natural rock formations. The station is very much active and running, having huge hangars filled with ships and trade.",,,
rodiniadesc,CUSTOM,"Despite the barren surface and the planet being inside an asteroid belt, Rodinia has a breathable atmosphere.",,"Rodinia is a small planet hidden inside an asteroid belt. Its position renders it vulnerable to meteor impacts but its upper crust is filled with valuable metals and minerals. Thus, Rodinia is, despite its hazardous surface, a prime candidate for mining and ship building.",,,

eupruskan_oath,FACTION,"The Oath is an elusive faction in the south of the Persean Sector. Their home system and innate hostility toward all factions were discovered by a group of independent scavengers, who had the misfortune to get attacked by one of their patrols. Only few survived and spread the tale of hulking ships in deep space, attacking anything.",,,,,
,,"Beside this, no further contact with the faction was established and any attempts to approach them, was met with hostilities. Historical experts assume the faction was built by manned Domain era terraforming or colony efforts.",,,,,
